;; 1.1  Arithmatic

#|
Every language comes with a language of defining data and a language
of operations on that data. Atomic data is used to repesent real-wrold
data in the lanuage. Programmers must learn to compose atomic data into
compound data to model the world. Programmers also compose those
operations on atomic data into programs.  Combinations of these two
parts of the language fallow the rules of arithetic.
