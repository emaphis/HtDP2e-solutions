;; Copy your solution to exercise 92 and modify the copy so that the chameleon
;; walks across a tricolor background. Our solution uses these colors

;(define BACKGROUND
;  (beside (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "green")
;          (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "white")
;          (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "red")))

;; but you may use any colors. Observe how the chameleon changes colors to
;; blend in as it crosses the border between two colors.

;; Note:
;; When you watch the animation carefully, you see the chameleon riding on a
;; white rectangle. If you know how to use image editing software, modify the
;; picture so that the white rectangle is invisible. Then the chameleon will
;; really blend in.
