2 Functions and Programs

As far as programming is concerned, “arithmetic” is half the game; the other
half is “algebra.” Of course, “algebra” relates to the school notion of
algebra as little/much as the notion of “arithmetic” from the preceding
chapter relates to arithmetic taught in grade-school arithmetic. Specifically,
the algebra notions needed are variable, function definition, function
application, and function composition.
This chapter reacquaints you with these notions in a fun and
accessible manner.
