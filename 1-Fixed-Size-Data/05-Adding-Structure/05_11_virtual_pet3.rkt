; Define a structure type that keeps track of the cat’s x-coordinate and its
; happiness. Then formulate a data definition for cats, dubbed VCat, including
; an interpretation.

; cat is a (make-vcat Number Number[0,100])
; interp.  (make-vcat x h) has an 'x; postition and an 'h' happyness level

;; happiness level. Let’s assume that the cat starts out with perfect happiness.

;; Ex. 91:
;; Extend your structure type definition and data definition from exercise 88
;; to include a direction field. Adjust your happy-cat program so that the cat
;; moves in the specified direction. The program should move the cat in
;; the current direction, and it should turn the cat around when it reaches
;; either end of the scene.
;; See cat4.rkt


;; Ex. 92:
;; Design the cham program, which has the chameleon continuously walking
;; across the canvas, from left to right. When it reaches the right end of the
;; canvas, it disappears and immediately reappears on the left. Like the cat,
;; the chameleon gets hungry from all the walking and, as time passes by, this
;; hunger expresses itself as unhappiness.
;; See chameleon1.rkt

;; Ex. 93:
;; Copy your solution to exercise 92 and modify the copy so that the chameleon
;; walks across a tricolor background. Our solution uses these colors

;(define BACKGROUND
;  (beside (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "green")
;          (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "white")
;          (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "red")))

;; but you may use any colors. Observe how the chameleon changes colors to
;; blend in as it crosses the border between two colors.

;; Note:
;; When you watch the animation carefully, you see the chameleon riding on a
;; white rectangle. If you know how to use image editing software, modify the
;; picture so that the white rectangle is invisible. Then the chameleon will
;; really blend in.
