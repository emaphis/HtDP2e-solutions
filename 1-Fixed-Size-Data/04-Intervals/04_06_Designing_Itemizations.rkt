;; Sales tax example

;; Sample Problem The state of Tax Land has created a three-stage sales
;; tax to cope with its budget deficit.
;; - Inexpensive items, those costing less than $1,000, are not taxed.
;; - Luxury items, with a price of morethan $10,000, are taxed at the
;;   rate of eight percent (8.00%).
;; - Everything in between comes with a five percent (5%) mark up.

;; Design a function for a cash register that given the price of an item,
;; computes the sales tax.

; A Price falls into one of three intervals:
; — 0 through 1000;
; — 1000 through 10000;
; — 10000 and above.
; interpretation the price of an item
