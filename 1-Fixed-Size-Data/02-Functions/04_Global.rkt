;; Examples

; the current price of a movie ticket
(define CURRENT-PRICE 5)

; useful to compute the area of a disk:
(define ALMOST-PI 3.14)

; a blank line:
(define NL "\n")

; an empty scene:
(define MT (empty-scene 100 100))

; literal constants
(define WIDTH 100)
(define HEIGHT 200)

; arbitrary expressions
(define MID-WIDTH (/ WIDTH 2))
(define MID-HEIGHT (/ HEIGHT 2))

;; Ex. 30:
;; Define constants for the price optimization program so that the price
;; sensitivity of attendance (15 people for every 10 cents) becomes a computed constant.
(define ATTENDEES 15)
(define PRICE 0.10)
(define PRICE-SENSITIVITY (/ ATTENDEES PRICE))  ; 150
